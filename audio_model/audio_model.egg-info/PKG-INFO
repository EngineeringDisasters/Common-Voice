Description: This modules uses data from Common voice which is a crowdsourcing project started by Mozilla to create a free database for speech recognition software. The project is supported by volunteers who record sample sentences with a microphone and review recordings of other users. The transcribed sentences will be collected in a voice database available under the public domain license CC0. This license ensures that developers can use the database for voice-to-text applications without restrictions or costs. Common Voice appeared as a response to the language assistants of large companies such as Amazon Echo, Siri or Google Assistant. In this modules I will provide an approach to classify in real time a person voice into the three broad categories of the commonvoice-voice-voice data set
